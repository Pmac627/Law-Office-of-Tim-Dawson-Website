				<h2 class="content-subtitle">HOW TO AVOID A DUI</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					Drink responsibly. Watch your intake and drink water when you social drink. Make sure you eat either before or 
                    during drinking. If you drink in excess, get a ride home if possible. If not, don't speed, stop at stop signs and 
                    lights, have your lights on and all vehicle lights functioning, and stay within your lane. A simple mistake like 
                    not using your turn signal can get you stopped. 
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content-section nix" id="blurb1">
				<h2 class="content-subtitle">WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE STOPPED BY THE POLICE</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					Be polite and courteous. Don't argue. Have your driver's license and registration in a convenient location so you 
                    can promptly hand it to the police without fumbling those documents. Politely ask why you were stopped. It may 
                    prove valuable down the road. Ask for a break if you feel you are going to be arrested. Tell them you will walk 
                    home or get a ride. It's the last chance you will have to avoid arrest. 
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content-section nix" id="blurb2">
				<h2 class="content-subtitle">SHOULD YOU VOLUNTEER A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					No, you should not. You should politely decline. You don't want to provide any evidence to the police to be used 
                    against you. Statements and confessions should be avoided. 
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content-section nix" id="blurb3">
				<h2 class="content-subtitle">WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE A WILL DRAFTED BY AN ATTORNEY</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					To assure it complies with the Statute of Wills. Wills are relatively inexpensive and it is smart to have a lawyer 
                    draft yours. That way, the lawyer keeps a copy and provides you two: one for you and one for your designated 
                    representative.
				</p>

			<section class="content-section nix" id="blurb4">
				<h2 class="content-subtitle">WHY SHOULD YOU HIRE AN ATTORNEY IF YOU ARE INJURED IN A VEHICLE COLLISION</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					Because your lawyer represents YOUR best interests, and the insurance adjuster assigned to your case is trying to save 
                    money for his or her company. The less they pay you, the better for them. Let Attorney Dawson handle the insurance 
                    companies and their adjusters and lawyers while you focus on recovering from your injuries.

			<section class="content-section nix" id="blurb5">
				<h2 class="content-subtitle">WHY YOU SHOULD HIRE AN ATTORNEY IF YOU ARE HURT AT WORK</h2>
				<p class="content-p">
					Because you don't know your rights or the laws in PA relating to Worker's Compensation and Attorney Dawson does. He has 
                    over 30 years experience in this area of the law, having represented hundreds of injured workers.
